# Hi there 👋

Hi, I'm a Research Assistant at Indian Institute of Science (IISc).
I'm interested in computer vision, deep learning, generative AI, and image processing. Most of my research is about inferring the physical world (shape, position, alignment, semantics etc.) from images. 

- ⚡ Fun fact: “Robot” comes from the Czech word robota, meaning“drudgery,” and first appeared in the 1921 play R.U.R.
